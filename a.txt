+ Compute the total number of flight routes
+ Compute and sort the longest flight routes
+ Display the airport with the highest degree vertex
+ List the most important airports according to PageRank
+ List the routes with the lowest flight costs

//Query 1 - Find the total number of airports
val numairports = Vertices Number
 
//Query 2 - Calculate the total number of routes?
val numroutes = Number Of Edges
 
//Query 3 - Calculate those routes with distances more than 1000 miles
graph.edges.filter { Get the edge distance )=> distance > 1000}.take(3)
 
//Similarly write Scala code for the below queries
//Query 4 - Sort and print the longest routes
//Query 5 - Display highest degree vertices for incoming and outgoing flights of airports
//Query 6 - Get the airport name with IDs 10397 and 12478
//Query 7 - Find the airport with the highest incoming flights
//Query 8 - Find the airport with the highest outgoing flights


//Query 9 - Find the most important airports according to PageRank
//Query 10 - Sort the airports by ranking
//Query 11 - Display the most important airports
//Query 12 - Find the Routes with the lowest flight costs
//Query 13 - Find airports and their lowest flight costs

//Query 14 - Display airport codes along with sorted lowest flight costs
